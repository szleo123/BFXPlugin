# BFXPlugin

Authors: Yilin Li and Linda Zhu

## Configuration
1. Since this Maya Plugin project contains the backend as a submodule, when cloning the repo you need to run:
   ```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/szleo123/BFXPlugin.git
   ```
3. From the `BFXPlugin` directory, run:
   * Windows: `cmake -B build -S . -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64` to generate the Visual Studio project.
4. Open the generated `BFX.sln` project inside `/build` directory.
5. Set `BFXPlugin` as the startup project in Visual Studio and build.
   * Refer to the **[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/LinDadaism/BrittleFractureSimulation?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting)** section for the `voro++` build errors.
   * If you encounter error `"cannot open include file voro++.hh: no such file or directory ..."`, go to the file that includes `"voro++.hh"` and change it to the absolute path on your local machine, e.g. `"C:/Users/.../BFXPlugin/BFX/voro/include/voro++.hh"`.
7. After the project is built, put `fractureUI.mel` in the same directory as the built `.mll` plugin.
   * By default, the `.mll` file is under `/build/bin/[Debug or Release]`.
8. Put `coacd.exe` in the same directoy as `.mll`.
9. Copy and paste `mpfr-6.dll` and `gmp-10.cll` from the build folder to Maya's library folder `{Your installation path}/Maya2022/bin`.
10. Now you should be able to load the plugin into Maya.

## Dev Notes
### Running BFXViewer inside this project
You need to change the relative path of the input OBJs because e.g. `../asset/obj/cube.obj` doesn't refer to the same location as in the standalone test app any more.

### [Git - Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
### Updating a repository that contains submodules
If you already have cloned a repository and now want to load itâ€™s submodules you have to use:
```
git submodule update --init
```
### Pulling with submodules
Once you have set up the submodules you can update the repository with `git fetch/pull` like you would normally do. To pull everything including the submodules, use the `--recurse-submodules` or the `--remote` parameter.
```
# pull all changes in the repo including changes in the submodules
git pull --recurse-submodules

# pull all changes for the submodules
# NOTE: Only check out the commit specified in the index of the superproject
git submodule update --remote
```
### Update submodules to the latest commit available from their remote
```
# Change to the submodule directory
cd BFX

# Checkout desired branch
git checkout main

# Update
git pull

# Get back to the superproject root
cd ..

# Now the submodules are in the state you want, so
git commit -am "Pulled down update to BFX"
```
